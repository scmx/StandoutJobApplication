HTML
----
Started with html back in 2005, and have been continually improving my skills ever since.

XHTML
-----
Most of my stuff have followed xhtml.

HTML5
-----
I recently started with it. I have started using new tags like header, footer, nav, article, section and aside.

CSS
---
Have done a lot of css. I am proud to say that after a bit of trial and error I can create any possible layout I want.

CSS3
----
I have tried many but far from all of the new features.

JavaScript
----------
Learned JS some years ago so I could customize websites like proboards. I always prefer CSS over JS. 

PHP
---
I usually code in php, with includes/requires, arrays and so on.
I have made several websites that use php.
Though I have not experimented much with databases, or built any big websites as of yet.

RUBY
----
I started with ruby as soon as I saw this job opportunity :)

RAILS
-----
Rails seems great, I aim to learn more of it ASAP!

XML
---
I know the syntax and formatting, I have used JavaScript and Php to access data in xml-files.

BASH
----
Have used bash-scripts in linux for automating tasks on many occasions. Scripting is fun!
Some scripts I have made: backup-scripts, simple services for things, parameters and so on.

JAVA
----
Studied Java at Chalmers in Gothenburg. Some skills: OOP, MVC, datastructures.
Some projects: Snake, memory, other simple games.

Linux-distros
-------------
Started with linux during my time at Chalmers (2008). I use it daily now. Some skills: command line, scripting, vim, ssh, crontab, config-files and OS-installations.

Visual Basic
------------
Studied Programming A+B at Sunnerbogymnasiet in 2006 and learned VB 1998.. I learned quickly and made simple games and other graphical programs.

TI-calculators
--------------
We had TI-82 Stats in school for Math A+B+C+D+E+Discrete. I realized I could make simple programs on it! Started creating functions for calculating things like the PQ-formula for solving Second-degree-equations. Eventually I made dozens of programs and formulas for usage in my maths and physics classes. Lots of fun :)
