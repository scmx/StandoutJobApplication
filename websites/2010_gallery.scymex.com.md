Photo Gallery
=============

Currently not available online :(

Me and my friend Ludvig Lam wanted a website for our photographs.

Developed: 2010 by me

PHP: Used to: handle pages, create links to photos, extract EXIF-data and dimensions from images, display a list of all images.
XHTML: Follows Strict XHTML
CSS: A floated list of thumbnails, transparent overlay when not :hover and other good stuff.
BASH: Script for manually creating thumbnails with mogrify.

Pros: Simple, functional and good looking?
Cons: No database, relies on setting a value for number of images and naming them 1.jpg, 2.jpg and so on. Did not know how to use mod_rewrite to create clean urls.
