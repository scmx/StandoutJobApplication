Minecraftserver
---------------
This is a swedish minecraftserver of which I am one of the founders. I play an important role in administration, maintenance and development.
We have 200 users since relaunch and rename in december 2011. It was originally called "Loadingservern" and have had totally around 600 in-game visitors.

Website development
--------------
Developed: 2010-2012, mostly by me.

PHP: Includes files, connects with phpbb3, manages pages
XHTML: Not converted to html5 yet (The phpbb3 forum uses xhtml)
CSS: Lots of .css-files for different pages. Two floating list menus. A few CSS3 shadows and rounded borders.
mod_rewrite: .htaccess for clean urls that links /about with ?page=about
phpbb3: Free forum-software

Cons: No CMS.

Forum
-----
We are 10 people that administrate the server and website through the forum.

Serveradministration
--------------------
We are 3 people with shell-acces and full responsibility for maintaining the server and website.

Serverhosting
--------------
Earlier, while in Gothenburg, I was the one hosting the server. This taught me a lot.
