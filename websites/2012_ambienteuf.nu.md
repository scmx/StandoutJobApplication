Ambiente UF
===========

http://ambienteuf.nu

This is the website for my sisters "UF-f√∂retag" (young business company). I gladly helped with a bit of coding.

Developed: 2012

PHP: 
    Used to include files for different pages and some arrays.
XHTML: 
    It is not using HTML5 yet.
CSS: 
    Used for the menu. Some CSS3 shadows and rounded borders.
mod_rewrite: 
    Clean urls. A file .htaccess makes it so that for example /omoss represents ?page=omoss
Flash: 
    I was not involved in this.
